Additional info :
Whatever your OS is, there is firewall for protecting your system even if you use hosting server from a provider. For servicing your application, I recommend to add rule for web service to the firewall. Flask uses the port number 5000 for web service. Add 5000 to your inbound rule to your firewall.
